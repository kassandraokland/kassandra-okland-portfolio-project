          <h2>Healthy Inspiration</h2>
          <p>Healthy Inspiration is the food blog I made for the Project Exam.</p>
          <h3>List of changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I added some div-tags to the blog posts so that I could display the content that I added from the WP REST API as flexbox.</li>
            <li>I added the modal function to the images, because didn't get the time to do that while I worked on the Project Exam.</li>
            <li>The font sizes needed some more testing and debugging. The main text was a little too small certain places, and the logo was a little too big on the wider screens.</li>
            <li>At middle length screens, the width between the logo and the navigation bar was to narrow, so I made it wider.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>
          <p>Community Science Museum is the website I made for Semester Project 1. This is the project that needed the most updates and tweaks.</p>
          <h3>List of changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I made the h1 smaller, because it was too big on screens over 650px and that made it look a little desperate.</li>
            <li>I added the modal function to the images, because I ran out of time </li>
            <li>I added call to action buttons to all landing pages that didn't already have one. The pages got one read more button and one buy tickets. The read more button brings you down the same page to the main content, while the buy ticket button brings you to a buy ticket page. The buy ticket page is also new. </li>
            <li>I added more hover and action styles, for instance to the cards of the menu page.</li>
            <li>I finished the content of the specific pages. Earlier I had just made the content for the first specific page.</li>
            <li>I added some missing alt tags on the explore page (for researchers picture) and on the index page (visiting prof. image).</li>
            <li>I transformed some h1 into other heading types, because I had multiple h1 tags on one page, and I have learnt now that you are not supposed to do that.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Red Pepper Pizzeria</h2>
          <p>Red Pepper Pizzeria is the website I made for the Cross Course Project. I'm resitting the Interaction Design Course Assignment, so I hadn't already made the changes we were supposed to do back then.</p>
          <h3>List of changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The call to action button on the menu page was too wide for mobile screens, so I had to make it smaller for it not to "collapse".</li>
            <li>I added the add to cart function.</li>
            <li>The mobile view of the menu page needed some padding on the edges, because the images were hugging the edges.</li>
            <li>On the home page the bottom section's text and buttons got a little small and hard to read/ interact with, so I improved that.</li>
            <li>The REST API call on the menu page had stopped working since last time I used it, so I had to fix that.</li>
          </ul>
